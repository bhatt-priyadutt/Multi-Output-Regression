# Multi-Output-Regression
* Overview:
Estimating customer value and extrapolating the existing value into future are the sought-after problems of any business. The current problem hails from the domain of online skill-based gaming.

* About the Data:
1. Provided feature space contains 22 variables spanning across multiple aspects of customer behavior.
2. Temporal variation is captured by a numbered sequence of entries for each customer.
3. The goal is to predict Y1 & Y2 which represent customer value and temporal extrapolation respectively.
4. Each customer can have N sequenced entries as input and only one set of (Y1, Y2) is expected as output.
